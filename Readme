This project involves the implementation of a live data streaming system from the FOREX trading API called Tiingo. The data is retrieved using Kafka, a distributed messaging platform, and processed in real-time using the integration of Spark-Kafka streaming. The project focuses on analyzing the FOREX data and subsequently visualizing the analyzed data by generating live graphs using Python libraries.
The technology stack utilized in this project includes Kafka for data ingestion, Hadoop for data storage and processing, Pyspark for real-time data analysis, and the Linux operating system for deployment and execution. These technologies are employed to ensure efficient and scalable data handling, analysis, and visualization in the context of FOREX trading.
